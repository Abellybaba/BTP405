Approach 1
This approach defines a function named doubleL that takes one number n. It makes a new empty list, then goes through each number from 0 up to n-1. For each number, it doubles it (multiplies by 2) and adds the doubled number to the list. After finishing with all numbers, it gives back the list it made. When we use doubleL(5), it prints each doubled number on the same line, separated by : .

Approach 2
This code does something similar to the above 1 but in a shorter way. It doubles each number from 0 to 4 right away and makes a list of these doubled numbers. Then it goes through this list and prints each number with : after it, all on the same line.

Approach 3
This code also doubles numbers like the first two approaches. But this time, it uses a special kind of function called doubleG that doesn't make a list all at once. Instead, it gives back each doubled number one by one whenever asked for the next one. This is done using something called yield. When we use doubleG(5), it prints each number it gives back, one at a time, with : after each number, all on the same line.

Type of Function doubleG(n) and Its Advantages:
doubleG(n) is a special function called a generator. Generators are great because:

They save memory by not making a whole list of numbers at once. Instead, they give each number one at a time.
They can be easier and simpler to use when you only need numbers one by one, instead of all at once.
They are good for handling big amounts of data without using up all your computer's memory.
