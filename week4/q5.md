Approach 1
This snippet defines a function doubleL(n) that takes a single argument n. It creates an empty list res and then iterates over a range from 0 to n-1 (inclusive). For each iteration, it calculates i \* 2 and appends this value to the list res. After completing the loop, the function returns the list res containing doubled values of all numbers in the specified range. The for loop outside the function definition iterates over the list returned by doubleL(5) and prints each value followed by : without moving to a new line for each value.

Approach 2
This snippet uses a list comprehension to achieve the same result as Approach 1 but in a more concise manner. The list comprehension [n * 2 for n in range(5)] directly generates a list of doubled values for numbers in the range from 0 to 4. This list is then iterated over in the for loop, printing each value followed by : similarly to Approach 1. List comprehensions are a more Pythonic and efficient way to create lists based on existing lists or iterables.

Approach 3
This snippet defines a function doubleG(n) that is a generator. A generator is a special type of iterator that lazily produces values, meaning it generates each value on the fly as needed rather than computing all values at once and storing them in memory like a list. The doubleG(n) function uses the yield statement to yield each doubled value i \* 2 for each iteration of the loop over the range from 0 to n-1. The for loop then iterates over the generator returned by doubleG(5), printing each value as it is generated, followed by : .

Type of Function doubleG(n) and Its Advantages
doubleG(n) is a generator function. Generator functions are a subset of Python functions that use the yield keyword to return data. The key characteristics and advantages of using a generator function like doubleG(n) include:

Memory Efficiency: Generators are more memory efficient than comparable functions that return lists, especially for large data sets, because they yield one item at a time and do not store the entire output in memory.
Laziness: Generators compute values on the fly and yield them one by one, which can be advantageous when working with large data sets or when you want to stop iteration based on a certain condition without having to generate all values upfront.
Simplicity: Generators can be used to simplify code that would otherwise require more complex logic to manage iteration and state.

In summary, the generator function doubleG(n) is a powerful tool for efficiently iterating over a sequence of values without the need to allocate memory for all values at once. This makes it particularly useful for memory-intensive tasks or when processing streams of data that do not fit into memory.
